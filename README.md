# Assignment

The assignment is crafted in such a way we can evaluate concretely if you (at this time) have the skills we are looking for since it is an accurate example of a ticket that might be assigned to you in our first week.

There are hardly any guidelines and for good reason. It allows us to learn a lot about you; how you take on this assignment more; how you deliver the completed assignment; and how you handle the uncertainty of working with new technologies. The goal is to really figure out how you will tackle an assignment once you are part of the team.

You have 3 weeks to accomplish the assignment below. If your assignment convinces us, you will be invited for the last step of the application process: an interview with a few of your future team members and management. If your assignment doesn't meet our standards, your hiring process ends here. In both cases, you will receive feedback on your assignment.

Enough said, good luck with the assignment!

Assignment:

1.	Create a non-fungible token that represents tickets for a festival and a fungible currency token using the chain technology of your choice (Solidity, Chaincode, Cordapp, ...)
o	There are maximum 1000 tickets
o	You can buy tickets from the organizer at a fixed price in the currency token
o	You can buy for and sell tickets to others, but the price can never be higher than 110% of the previous sale
o	Add a monetization option for the organizer in the secondary market sales
2.	Create a small web app to show the current state (supply, what the accounts own, balances) and buttons to demonstrate the different functions.

Minimal requirements:
•	Include a docker-compose file to spin up the infrastructure needed to run the app
•	Documentation is everything, explain what happens and how to run/deploy

Delivery:
•	Send me a Github/GitLab/… link to the source code and docs
